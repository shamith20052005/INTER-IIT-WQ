# Quantitative Analysis Challenge - World Quant

This project contains three unique alpha (mathematical trading models) ideas covering the following topics:

1. Volume Decay
2. Size Effect
3. Call Option Implied Volatility

After developing the basic ideas, we enhanced our strategies using a machine framework and the BRAIN API. (Code regarding this can be found in the [Main Code](https://github.com/shamith20052005/INTER-IIT-WQ/blob/main/maincode.ipynb))

We later backtested our alphas on **US Equity Markets**.

We have provided all the performance metrics, including:
1. Sharpe Ratio
2. Turnover
3. Fitness
4. Returns

A detailed analysis is presented in the [Submission PDF](https://github.com/shamith20052005/INTER-IIT-WQ/blob/main/WorldQuant%20submission.pdf).
